# Logistic-regression

This is the code for performing logistic regression for testing of association between NLR or GWAS SNP windows and a window-based metric.

## Software Requirements

This script was tested with:  
R==4.4.1  
tidyverse==2.0.0

## Installation

Clone this repository.  
Install R and Rstudio.  
Install the required packages from cran.  
And then you can run the script.

## Usage

The script is supposed to be run interactively in an R session.

## Input files
 
`20240618_Suppl_File_1_windows.csv.gz` [Window-based file with many different population genomic metrics, and NLR-gene + GWAS SNP presence (also available from supplemental file 1 from the paper)]

## Output files

None. The output is the printed test scores of the logistic regression

## Runtime
Typical runtime: 1 minute
